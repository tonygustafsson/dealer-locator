# Dealer Locator
This is a simple vanilla JavaScript library for loading Google Maps with markers defined in a JSON file.
It implements clustering of markers with a plugin, and makes it possible to link to a marker with an ordinary link.

In the example here, the list of dealers is hard coded, but you should of course generate this yourself with the same backend logic 
as the one creating the JSON file. It wouldn't be hard to generate the list of dealers from JavaScript either, but it's not good for SEO.
